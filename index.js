// i already completed this on the prep course lesson, but I want to try it again now that I understand my mistakes better. Here's to hoping I don't make the same mistakes!! :don

function theBeatlesPlay(musicians, instruments) {
 var array = [];
 
 for(var i = 0; i < musicians.length; i++) {
   var str = musicians[i] + " plays " + instruments[i];
   array.push(str);
 }
 return array;
}

// okay, biggest problem with the for loops is the initialization bit--you keep forgetting to make it a VARIABLE "(var i = 0;)" instead of just (i=0) you pleb
